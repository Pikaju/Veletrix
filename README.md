# Veletrix Engine

A game engine I wrote when I was around the age of 16.
It is written in C++ and OpenGL, while being designed to allow for Direct3D and Vulkan implementations.
I used it for many of my game prototypes, even though many of its features are incomplete.

## Features

* A self-written math library including vectors, matrices and quaternions
* Window creation through either SDL or GLFW
* OpenGL graphics with support for textures, shaders, framebuffers and more
* Basic audio support with OpenAL
* Basic physics support with Bullet
* Basic networking support through datagram sockets
